# KubePattern

**A static and dynamic analysis tool to discover smells in Kubernetes clusters and suggest patterns to apply.**

## ✨ Overview

KubePattern is an innovative project that helps you identify configuration issues, anti-patterns, and improvement opportunities in your Kubernetes clusters. It combines static and dynamic analysis techniques to provide actionable insights and recommendations.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Static Analysis** - Analyze Kubernetes manifests and configurations before deployment
- **Dynamic Analysis** - Monitor running clusters to detect runtime issues and smells
- **Pattern As Code** - Define and customize patterns using a declarative, code-based approach
- **Kubernetes Native** - Analysis reports delivered through Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
- **Highly Customizable** - Extend and tailor the analysis to your specific needs

## 📋 How It Works

1. **Define Patterns** - Create custom patterns using the Pattern As Code approach
2. **Run Analysis** - Execute static or dynamic analysis on your clusters
3. **Review Reports** - Access detailed reports via Kubernetes CRDs
4. **Apply Recommendations** - Implement suggested patterns to improve your cluster

## 🔧 Pattern As Code

KubePattern's Pattern As Code approach allows you to define detection rules and recommendations as code, making it easy to:

- Version control your patterns
- Share patterns across teams
- Customize rules for your environment
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
